# chat.sfu.codes

ðŸ’¬ A chat room and React sandbox for SFU Code

## What is it?

As an opportunity for club members to get familiar with React, we started this chat app. The goal of the project is to provide an introduction to React development in the form of a chat web app.

## Development

At the moment, this project is bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To learn more about React, check out the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), the [official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), and [this crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A71aqufiNtQ).

## Deployment

The `master` branch is deployed automatically on Heroku, and made available at [chat.sfu.codes](http://chat.sfu.codes).

## Contributing

Feel free to create a branch for your feature, and we can merge it into `development` when it's ready.
